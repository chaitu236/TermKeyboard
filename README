# TermKeyboard
This program injects keyboard events from your terminal into the OS.

Use case: If you've a raspberry pi, and have connected it to a monitor, but you don't have a keyboard to connect to it, you can ssh into it from another computer (or phone), run this program and use its keyboard for the raspberry pi.

Modifier keys (CTRL and ALT) work only with only the a-z keys (e.g., ALT+F4 won't work.. )
If you're missing functionality of any key, open an issue.
